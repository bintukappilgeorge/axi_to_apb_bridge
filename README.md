# Introduction

The AXI to APB Bridge is designed to facilitate communication between an AXI bus and an APB bus. The AXI interface operates at a higher frequency (100MHz), whereas the APB interface runs at a lower frequency (50MHz). The bridge buffers transactions between the two domains using a FIFO structure, ensuring seamless data transfer despite clock domain differences.
